{"name":"{less} for [B]rackets","tagline":"compile {less} files from within [B]rackets... automatically!","body":"# {less} for [B]rackets\r\n================================================================================\r\nan extension that adds automatic compilation of {less} files upon saving.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n{less} for [B]rackets is installed from the Brackets Extension Manager. Please restart Brackets after installing the extension.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Compile Options\r\n\r\nLESS compile options can be set in the first line of the edited file:\r\n\r\n      `// out: ../dist/app.css, compress: true, strictMath: true`\r\n\r\n_Option Commands_\r\n\r\n    `out`\r\n\r\nredirect the css output to a different file\r\n\r\n    `main`\r\n\r\ncompile a different file instead of this one (ignores all other options)\r\n\r\n    `compress`\r\n\r\ncompress the css output\r\n\r\n    `strictMath`\r\n\r\nrequire brackets around math expressions\r\n\r\n    `sourceMap`\r\n\r\ngenerate a source map\r\n\r\n    `autoprefixer`\r\n\r\nvalue is passed as browsers to the autoprefixer-plugin, use a semicolon  `;` to separate multiple character entries.  Uses [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer/).\r\n\r\n    `cleancss`\r\n\r\nvalue is passed as compatibility to the cleancss-plugin - (not compatible with source-maps) Uses [clean-css](https://github.com/jakubpawlowicz/clean-css/).\r\n\r\n####Untested Options\r\nOther less compiler options might also work, but are currently untested.\r\n\r\nSee [Grunt LESS](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-less#options) for an extensive of options.\r\n\r\n### Project-wide Compile Options\r\n\r\nYou can tell the extension to always compile a specific set of files in a project independent of the edited file by creating a configuration file called `.brackets.json` or `compile.json` in your project's root folder:\r\n\r\n       `{ \"less\": [ \"path/to/file1.less\", \"path/to/file2.less\" ] }`\r\n\r\nAll file paths must be relative to the project's root folder. To disable less-autocompile for a project, specify an empty list of files:\r\n\r\n        `{ \"less\": [] }`\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\nHow can I redirect the output to a separate file?\r\n\r\n> Add the following line to the head of your less file:\r\n> \r\n>     // out: new-file.css\r\n\r\nHow can I supress compiling this less file / compile a different less file than the one being edited?\r\n\r\n> Add a reference to the master.less file to the head of the imported less file:\r\n> \r\n>     // main: master.less\r\n\r\nHow can I supress the compilation of a single less file\r\n\r\n> Set out to null\r\n>\r\n>     // out: null\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgements\r\n\r\n* Thanks to [James Lawrence](https://github.com/jlaw90) for enabling relative imports in less.\r\n* Thanks to [Martin Zagora](https://github.com/zaggino) for adding the less verison number to the output.\r\n* Thanks to [Dimitar S.](https://github.com/deemeetar) for allowing users to specify a custom output path.\r\n* Thanks to [FezVrasta](https://github.com/FezVrasta) for tweaking the less compiler settings.\r\n* Thanks to [Kenneth Ruddick](https://github.com/KenRud) for the compile.json configuration addition.\r\n* Thanks to [Florian Fida](https://github.com/piccaso) for kicking off autoprefixer and cleancss support.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Jonathan Diehl\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
